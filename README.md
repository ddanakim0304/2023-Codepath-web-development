# Protect the Whales (Version 2!!)! 🌊🐋

Welcome to the **Protect the Whales** project! This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code I developed as part of the Codepath Web101 course. This project was developed based on my previous GWC project (refer to '/2021-Girls-Who-Code-Activism-website').

## About the Project

This project aims to raise awareness about the importance of whale conservation. Whales play a crucial role in maintaining the health of our oceans, and it is vital to protect them from threats such as pollution, climate change, and illegal hunting.

## Technologies Used
