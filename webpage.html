    <p> Whale hunting, or whaling, poses a significant problem due to its detrimental impact on endangered whale
      populations and marine ecosystems. This practice threatens the long-term survival of these majestic creatures
      while disrupting the delicate balance of the ocean food web. To address this issue, global cooperation is crucial
      in enforcing and strengthening regulations that protect whales, promote conservation efforts, and find
      alternatives to the cultural and economic aspects associated with whaling. Ultimately, preserving the world's
      oceans and their inhabitants hinges on a responsible and sustainable approach to managing and conserving these
      magnificent marine mammals.

    <h2>Impact!</h2>

    <img src="img/whale-1.jpg" width="500" height="500" />
    <h3>Where can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p> Whaling has led to the depletion of several whale species, disrupting marine ecosystems and reducing
      biodiversity.
    </p>

    <img src="img/whale-2.jpg" width="500" />
    <h3>Where else can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p> The extensive hunting of whales has resulted in the release of large amounts of carbon stored in whale carcasses
      into the ocean, potentially impacting carbon cycling and nutrient distribution in marine ecosystems.

        <h3>Whale hunting resumes in Iceland under strict rules</h3>
        <p>The Icelandic government has lifted a summer suspension on whaling, allowing hunting to resume under new
          regulations. Only one company, Hvalur, still hunts whales in Iceland, and the season is nearing its end.
          Critics are upset about this decision, with many Icelanders wanting an end to whaling.</p>
